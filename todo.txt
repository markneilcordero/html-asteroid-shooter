# 🎯 Strategy Tip:
**✅** After you complete a section, **test it thoroughly** before moving to the next.  
**✅** Build one feature **at a time**, not everything at once.
**✅** Use a separate **`build.js`** or **`todo.txt`** file to track what you're working on each day.

Would you also like me to make you a **starter folder structure** suggestion 📂 (like `images/`, `sounds/`, `scripts/`, etc.)?  
That way your project will stay super clean and organized from the beginning! 🚀  
(Just say: **"Yes, starter structure please!"**)
